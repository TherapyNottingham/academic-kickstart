## What you can expect
Choosing a therapist can be difficult, so I’ve tried to include some relevant information about me and how I work.  I have been working with clients since 2011 and have been in private practice since 2013.

### As a therapist you can expect me to:

- provide a safe, confidential place, where you can talk about yourself and your life, which may be painful or confusing and may make you feel uncomfortable, angry or unhappy
- give you the opportunity to think and talk about yourself and your concerns in a way that you often can’t do with family and friends
- offer a place and time which is just for you to talk about those things that bother you
- listen to the way you feel and how this affects you and others
- accept the way you are without judging you
- help you to make the changes you would like to happen
- work hard to create a good therapeutic relationship with you so that we can work well together
- understand that it is not always easy to talk about problems and to express your feelings
- work with you towards improving your well being

### Some things I won’t do:

- offer to ‘cure’ you
- judge you
- make decisions for you
- take advantage of you
- spend time talking about my problems inappropriately

I work within the [BACP Ethical framework](https://www.bacp.co.uk/events-and-resources/ethics-and-standards/ethical-framework-for-the-counselling-professions/) and the [UKCP code of ethics](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/registers-standards/standards-guidance-and-policies/), which set out the values and principles underpinning good practice, and ultimately help ensure that you receive a safe and effective service.

## What I believe

There are many different styles, modalities and theories that therapists work within.  As an Integrative psyhotherapist I work with a relational and developmental focus, which is underpinned by some core humanistic values.  For most people that doesn’t mean very much, so this is what I mean.

Humanistic therapies are all based broadly similar beliefs, and there are many theories and ways of understanding people that have stemmed from this.  But there are also lots of other ways to approach this.  I don’t stick rigidly to ‘a way to do therapy’ but incorporate aspects of many different theories including some of the ‘non-humanistic’ ones.  I do this because I believe that they are useful and helpful to the work of therapy.  Just as no two people are ever the same, I don’t believe that any one sort of therapy can ever be adequate for everyone.

### Relational

I place particular importance and value on the relationship that develops between myself and the client.  I believe that we all exist in relationship with the world around us, and so when we are trying to make changes, or solve problems, or make sense of our experiences, we also do that in relationship.  Therapy is very different to most other relationships you may have – that’s part of it’s value, but it is still a relationship.

### Developmental

No, this doesn’t mean it’s all you mother’s fault.  However I do believe that we learn a lot of the things that we believe about ourselves and other people during our early formative years.  As we grow and develop, and the world around us changes, we can find that the things we have always ‘known’ and the things we ‘do’ to solve problems or make decisions do not always work so well for us.  By exploring this together, it is possible to begin to make sense of why that might be happening, and then from that, to find options for how it could be different.

### Humanistic

This describes my basic beliefs about people:

- everyone has essential worth
- people are not good or bad – we all have the potential for both
- we all have the capacity to choose
- people are responsible for themselves
- people have the power to change and grow
- we exist in relationship with the world around us
- the truth about people is more than the sum of all the parts
